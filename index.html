<h3><a name="about" class="anchor" href="#about"></a>About Me</h3>
<p>
  I'm Catherine Gosmeyer.  I'm a NASA-contracted scientific software developer and analyst, demi-planetary scientist, and geospatial information science graduate student.  Python is my language of choice.  I'm also an editor for the <a href="https://ascl.net">Astrophysics Source Code Library</a> and webmaster for the <a href="http://dps.aas.org/">American Astronomical Society Division for Planetary Sciences (DPS)</a>.  I'm passionate about space policy and advocate with the Planetary Society and DPS for steady, reliable funding for the exploration of the Solar System.
